### CF 401 Week 3 Pyramid Project


**Author**: Beverly
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Build an application that allows us to list and analyze data about stocks. The overall goal will be to allow users to log in, log out, add stocks to their portfolio so that they may monitor them, and eventually include a machine learning component that'll extract trends in their price history.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Added functionality to add and delete some things.
-->
03-30-2018 - Begin scaffolding HTML
